## 🏎️ F1 Race Outcome Prediction

This project builds a machine learning pipeline to predict Formula 1 race outcomes using multiple perspectives of race data. It combines driver performance, lap times, pit stop strategies, and constructor reliability into a unified meta-model for accurate race prediction.

### 🔑 Key Features
Driver Model → Predicts individual driver performance (wins, podium chances).
Lap Model → Estimates lap times and consistency.
Pitstop Model → Analyzes strategy efficiency (undercut/overcut, pit timing).
Constructor Model → Evaluates team reliability and historical strength.
Meta Model (Stacking Ensemble) → Combines outputs of all sub-models for final race outcome prediction.

### ⚙️ Tech Stack
Python, Pandas, NumPy
Scikit-learn (ML models & evaluation)
Pickle (model persistence)
Streamlit (for user interface, optional)

### 📊 Workflow
Collect and preprocess historical F1 datasets (drivers, laps, pit stops, constructors).
Train individual models on their respective datasets.
Generate intermediate predictions from each model.
Train a meta-model to combine sub-model predictions into a final outcome.
Deploy the pipeline for race predictions based on user input features.

### 🚀 Outcome

A modular and extensible F1 race prediction system that mimics real-world race dynamics by blending multiple perspectives into a single decision-making pipeline.
